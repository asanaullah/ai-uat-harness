# AI Inference UAT Harness
A declarative test harness that generates Kubernetes manifests from test definitions. Given a cluster configuration (target nodes, namespace, and storage) and a test suite, the generator produces manually-executable manifests and numbered shell scripts that can be run interactively or driven headlessly on OpenShift.

## How It Works

The generator reads test definitions (YAML + Go source), a cluster config describing target nodes, and a tool config. It produces its output from an ordered internal step list:

- **Manual output** (`build/manual/`) — numbered shell scripts in execution order, plus a `manifests/` subdirectory with the YAML manifests they reference. Run the scripts in order with `bash`, drive them interactively with `scripts/manual_runner.py`, or run the whole suite headlessly with `scripts/auto_runner.py`.

The output is derived from an ordered step list, so the underlying Kubernetes workloads (pods, services, configmaps) are consistent regardless of how the scripts are driven.


```
Test Definitions (YAML + Go) + Node List → python -m src → Steps → Manual Manifests → OpenShift Execution → Results on PVC
                                              ↑
                                       steps.json (optional re-entry point)
```

### Generation

The generator separates step computation (what to run) from the writer (how to run it). A writer is an independent consumer of the step list, so adding a new execution backend means writing a new writer — step computation doesn't change.

1. **Step computation** — converts test definitions into a flat, ordered list of steps. Each step is either a resource to create (pod manifest, optionally bundled with a service, or an arbitrary Kubernetes resource manifest) or an action to execute (apply a manifest, exec into a pod, delete resources). Ordering is implicit in list position. The writer consumes this step list.

2. **Manual writer** — writes the steps as standalone files to `build/manual/`, organized by phase (setup, test, teardown). Numbered `.sh` scripts in `manual/` are what the operator runs in order. Manifests are written to `manual/manifests/` as data files — each apply script references its manifest via `oc apply -f manifests/<name>.yaml`.

### Intermediate DAG (steps.json)

After step computation and before writing output, the generator serializes the full step list to `build/steps.json`. This file captures the complete DAG — setup, test, and teardown steps — along with the tool and cluster config used to produce them.

The generator can also consume `steps.json` as input via `--steps`, skipping config loading and step computation entirely:

```bash
# Normal: compute steps from config, write steps.json + manual
python -m src --test-suite examples/all_tests.yaml --test-lib test_lib --cluster cluster/ocp-test.yaml

# From steps: load steps.json, write manual
python -m src --steps build/steps.json
```

This enables a two-phase workflow for custom step injection:

1. Generate `steps.json` from config
2. Edit the file — add, remove, or reorder steps
3. Re-run with `--steps` to produce output from the modified DAG

The file is validated on load with Pydantic (field types, metadata structure) and structural checks (unique pod names, source references point to existing generate steps, valid command and probe values, service name DNS-1035 compliance, and failure policy labels).

### Execution Flow

```
Run order (single ordered step list):
  Setup:    apply-configmap → create-builder → build
  Tests:    [tests in test suite list order]
              node-scoped: parallel per node
              cluster-scoped: one sequence per node set (sequential)
              project-scoped: single sequence (no node affinity)
  Teardown: create-aggregator → aggregate → cleanup  (always runs)
```

Each test produces one or more step sequences depending on scope: one per node (node-scoped, parallel, pinned via `nodeSelector`), one per node set (cluster-scoped, sequential, pinned via `nodeSelector`), or a single sequence (project-scoped, no `nodeSelector`). All sequences follow the same lifecycle:

```
Sequence per node:
  resource:   apply arbitrary K8s resource (e.g. InferencePool)
  persistent: deploy pod, wait for readiness (stays up)
  ephemeral:  run test pod → cleanup (per sweep entry, releases resources)
  after all DAG steps: teardown persistent + resource-step resources
  finally-teardown: safety-net (always runs)
```

After each test completes, the runner checks for failures and applies the test's failure policy.

### Test Scopes

Tests are organized into three scopes based on where and how they run:

- **Node** — validates individual nodes in isolation. Each node-scoped test runs independently on every target node listed in the cluster config, pinned via `nodeSelector`. All node sequences execute in parallel. Use for hardware validation, GPU diagnostics, driver checks, and single-node inference benchmarks.

- **Cluster** — validates behavior that spans multiple nodes but still requires node pinning. Cluster-scoped tests use a `placement` config to filter eligible nodes, generate node sets (combinations or permutations), and pin each DAG step to a specific node within the set. Sets run sequentially — each completes fully before the next begins. Use for multi-node coordination tests like distributed training, inter-node networking, or GPU-to-GPU communication across nodes.

- **Project** — validates namespace-level resources with no node affinity. Project-scoped tests run as a single chain without `nodeSelector`, letting the scheduler place pods freely. Use for namespace quota checks, RBAC validation, service mesh configuration, or any test that operates at the project level rather than targeting specific hardware.

Tests are registered in the test suite (see `examples/all_tests.yaml`) as an ordered list, each with a scope and failure policy:

```yaml
spec:
  tests:
    - name: platform-check
      scope: project
      onFailure: continue

    - name: component
      scope: node
      onFailure: continue

    - name: guidellm
      scope: node
      onFailure: abort
      timeout: 1200

    - name: iperf3
      scope: cluster
      onFailure: continue
```

The `onFailure` field controls what happens when a step within the test fails (default: `continue`):
- `continue` — all steps run regardless of failures. The runner proceeds to the next test.
- `skipTest` — remaining steps in the failing test's sequence are skipped (teardown still runs). The runner proceeds to the next test. For node-scoped tests, only the failing node's sequence is skipped; other nodes complete normally.
- `abort` — remaining steps in the failing test's sequence are skipped, then the runner skips every remaining test and goes straight to teardown/cleanup. For node-scoped tests, only the failing node's sequence is skipped; other nodes complete normally before the run moves on to cleanup.

The optional `timeout` field (integer, seconds) overrides the `defaultTestTimeout` from `config.yaml` for this test's ephemeral pods.

#### Placement (Cluster Scope)

Cluster-scoped tests accept a `placement` config that controls how pods are distributed across nodes:

```yaml
spec:
  tests:
    - name: network
      scope: cluster
      onFailure: continue
      placement:
        setSize: 2
        setType: combination
        setSelection: all
        setCutoff: 3
        setRequirements:
          nvidia.com/gpu: 4
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `setSize` | `1` | Number of distinct nodes per set. When `> 1`, DAG step *i* is pinned to node *i* of the set |
| `setType` | `combination` | `combination` (unordered, {A,B} = {B,A}) or `permutation` (ordered, (A,B) ≠ (B,A)) |
| `setSelection` | `random` | `random` picks a single random set; `all` uses every generated set |
| `setCutoff` | `1` | Limits the number of sets when `setSelection: all`. `0` means no limit |
| `setRequirements` | `{}` | Filters eligible nodes by `componentValidation.sanity` fields. Numeric fields are minimums, string fields are exact matches |

### PVC Directory Hierarchy

Every DAG step gets a unique directory on the PVC, computed transparently by the generator. Step names encode all hierarchy information (test_id, test name, node, DAG step), so directories are flat under the timestamp. Test pods write to `/uat_workspace` and files land in the right place via `subPath` mounting.

```
<basePath>/<timestamp>/
  binaries/
    <test_name>/test.bin
  <test_id>-<test>-<node>-<dag_step>/        (node-scoped)
    junit.xml
    ...
  <test_id>-<test>-<set>-<dag_step>/          (cluster-scoped, multiple sets; <set> is a 4-digit index, e.g. 0000)
    junit.xml
  <test_id>-<test>-<dag_step>/               (cluster single set / project-scoped)
    junit.xml
  report/
    summary.json
```

DAG pods also get a second mount at `/binaries` for access to compiled test binaries.

## Cluster Setup

The `setup/` directory contains Kubernetes manifests and scripts for one-time cluster preparation:

- **`user-namespaces-and-pvcs.yaml`** — creates the `uat-project`, `uat-peer`, and `uat-runner` namespaces (each labeled `massopen.cloud/project`), their PVCs, and RBAC. `uat-project` and `uat-peer` each get a 50Gi RWX PVC for test results (`uat-project-storage`, `uat-peer-storage`) and a 100Gi RWX PVC (`uat-models`) for pre-downloaded model weights, plus a namespace-scoped Role + RoleBinding granting the test user access to pods, services, configmaps, and (in `uat-project`) workload APIs (jobs, jobsets, kubeflow, kserve, ray). `uat-runner` gets the runner's workspace and binary PVCs (`uat-runner-storage` 100Gi, `uat-runner-bin` 10Gi) and the `uat-runner-sa` ServiceAccount, which is bound to the test-user Role in the other two namespaces. `uat-project` and `uat-peer` also get a NetworkPolicy that permits same-namespace pod-to-pod traffic plus external egress. It is needed because the cluster's BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy denies tenant traffic by default — including same-namespace east-west — so builds and pod-to-service communication would otherwise fail.
- **`admin-namespace-and-pvcs.yaml`** — everything for the admin platform checks, kept separate because it needs cluster-admin to apply: the `uat-admin` namespace, a 50Gi RWX PVC for test results (`uat-admin-storage`), a `uat-sa` ServiceAccount, a namespace-scoped admin Role, the same NetworkPolicy the test namespaces get, and a **ClusterRole + ClusterRoleBinding** granting read access to cluster-scoped resources (nodes, deployments, DataScienceClusters, ClusterPolicies, NodeFeatureDiscoveries, ServiceMeshControlPlanes).
- **`model-downloader.yaml`** — one-shot pods (one per namespace) that download HuggingFace models to the models PVC. Add models to the `MODELS` list and re-run.
- **`prewarm-images.sh`** — a script that pre-pulls ("warms") every container image used by the test library onto each GPU node in a cluster config, so real test runs don't stall or time out on first-time image pulls. Launches a throwaway pod per (node × image), waits for the pulls to cache, then deletes the pods. Run with `setup/prewarm-images.sh cluster/ocp-test.yaml`.
- **`auto_runner.yaml`** — the `uat-runner` pod, which clones this repo, runs the build, and drives the whole suite unattended as the `uat-runner-sa` ServiceAccount. Its configuration is the `env` block: `REPO_URL`, `BUILD_CMD`, and an optional `REPO_BRANCH`. Set `REPO_BRANCH` to a branch or tag to run that instead of the default branch, so a change can be tested from a pushed branch before it is merged; leave it empty otherwise.

Apply in order:

```bash
oc apply -f setup/user-namespaces-and-pvcs.yaml
# only for the admin platform checks (needs cluster-admin):
oc apply -f setup/admin-namespace-and-pvcs.yaml
oc apply -f setup/model-downloader.yaml
# wait for downloads to complete:
oc logs -f model-downloader -n uat-project
oc logs -f model-downloader -n uat-peer
# optionally pre-pull test images onto the GPU nodes:
setup/prewarm-images.sh cluster/ocp-test.yaml
```

### Clusters managed by oac-apps

On an Open Accelerator cluster where [oac-apps](https://github.com/CCI-MOC/oac-apps) deploys the `uat-harness` chart (currently `oac-dev-workload0`), do not apply `user-namespaces-and-pvcs.yaml`. The chart creates the same resources through ArgoCD, and ArgoCD reverts anything changed by hand. What the chart provides:

- The `uat-project`, `uat-peer`, and `uat-runner` namespaces, with their NetworkPolicies, Roles, RoleBindings, and the `uat-runner-sa` ServiceAccount.
- The PVCs, under the same names the cluster configs use. Sizes are set in `charts/uat-harness/values.yaml` in oac-apps; to change one, open a pull request there. A PVC can be grown but not shrunk.
- Access for members of the `project-uat` Keycloak group instead of an individual user. Ask to be added to the group to run tests.

The `uat-admin` namespace and the cluster-scoped RBAC for the admin platform checks are not part of the chart.

Setup on such a cluster is then only the run-time pieces:

```bash
oc apply -f setup/model-downloader.yaml
# wait for downloads to complete:
oc logs -f model-downloader -n uat-project
oc logs -f model-downloader -n uat-peer
# optionally pre-pull test images onto the GPU nodes:
setup/prewarm-images.sh cluster/oac-dev-workload0.yaml
```

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- An OpenShift cluster with `oc` configured
- A PVC with **ReadWriteMany (RWX)** access mode (e.g. CephFS, NFS). Multi-node runs pin pods to different nodes that share one PVC — RWO block storage will fail at scheduling.
- A separate RWX PVC for model weights, referenced via `storage.models.pvc` in the cluster config (see [Cluster Setup](#cluster-setup))
- Nodes labeled with `kubernetes.io/hostname`
- For headless runs: a service account with permissions to create/delete pods, services, and configmaps, and to exec into pods in the target namespace

### Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate Manifests

```bash
python -m src \
  --test-suite examples/all_tests.yaml \
  --test-lib test_lib \
  --cluster cluster/ocp-test.yaml \
  --config config.yaml \
  --templates-dir templates \
  --scripts-dir scripts
```

Output is written to `build/manual/`.

### CLI Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--test-suite` | (required\*) | Path to the test suite YAML |
| `--test-lib` | (required\*) | Directory containing test definition YAMLs and Go source files |
| `--cluster` | (required\*) | Path to the cluster config YAML |
| `--config` | `config.yaml` | Path to the tool config |
| `--run-id` | `manual-run` | Timestamp substitute for manual output |
| `--output` | `build` | Output directory |
| `--templates-dir` | `templates` | Path to Jinja2 templates |
| `--scripts-dir` | `scripts` | Path to support scripts (e.g. `aggregate.py`) |
| `--steps` | | Path to a `steps.json` file; skips config loading and step computation |

\* Not required when `--steps` is provided.

### Run Manually

Scripts are numbered in execution order. Run them sequentially:

```bash
# Run all scripts in order
for f in build/manual/*.sh; do
  echo "Running $f"
  bash "$f"
done
```

Or run selectively — setup scripts come first, then test scripts (steps that run in parallel across nodes share the same counter), then teardown scripts at the end:

```bash
# Setup (first few scripts)
bash build/manual/01-apply-configmap.sh
bash build/manual/02-create-builder.sh
bash build/manual/03-build.sh

# Test scripts follow (numbered 04+)
# ...

# Teardown (final scripts)
bash build/manual/N-create-aggregator.sh
bash build/manual/N-aggregate.sh
bash build/manual/N-cleanup.sh
```

#### Interactive Runner (`scripts/manual_runner.py`)

For running a suite interactively rather than script-by-script, `scripts/manual_runner.py` is a curses dashboard over the same `build/` output. It loads `steps.json` and the `manual/*.sh` scripts and presents a full-screen view where you select and run individual lifecycle items (configmap, builds, aggregate, final cleanup) or per-test items, watch each step's status (PENDING / RUNNING / OK / FAILED / SKIPPED), and tail live logs against a running cluster. Steps that share a sequence number run in parallel, and `finally` steps always run last even after a failure. Every run writes timestamped shell and pod logs under `build/logs/`, plus an appended `logs/timesheet.csv` (one row per executed step).

```bash
python3 scripts/manual_runner.py build
```

## Adding a Custom Test

Adding a test requires three things: an entry in the test suite, a test definition YAML, and a Ginkgo test file.

### 1. Register the Test

Add the test to your test suite:

```yaml
spec:
  tests:
    - name: component
      scope: node
      onFailure: continue
    - name: guidellm
      scope: node
      onFailure: abort
      timeout: 1200
    - name: my-test           # add here
      scope: node
      onFailure: continue
```

### 2. Create the Test Definition

Create `test_lib/my-test.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: uat.openshift.io/v1
kind: Test
metadata:
  name: my-test
  version: v0.0.1
  description: Short description of what this test validates
  supportedScopes:
    - node
    - project
spec:
  source:
    ginkgo: my-test.go

  dag:
    - name: test-runner
      image: registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest
      labelFilter: pass-fail
      env:
        - name: NODE_NAME
          value: '{{ nodeSpec.name }}'
      persistsThroughSweep: false
      parameterSweep: null
```

### 3. Write the Ginkgo Test

Create `test_lib/my-test.go`:

```go
package test

import (
    "testing"

    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2"
    . "github.com/onsi/gomega"
)

func TestMyTest(t *testing.T) {
    RegisterFailHandler(Fail)
    RunSpecs(t, "My Test Suite")
}

var _ = Describe("My Test", Label("pass-fail"), func() {
    It("should validate something", func() {
        Expect(true).To(BeTrue())
    })
})
```

The `Label("pass-fail")` must match the `labelFilter` in the test YAML. The compiled binary runs with `--ginkgo.label-filter=pass-fail` to select which specs execute.

### 4. Generate and Run

```bash
python -m src --test-suite examples/all_tests.yaml --test-lib test_lib --cluster cluster/ocp-test.yaml
```

The generated output compiles `my-test.go` into a binary on the builder pod and runs it on each target node.

## Test Definition Reference

### Metadata

Each test definition has a `metadata` section that declares properties used by the generator at load time:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Human-readable test name (informational only) |
| `supportedScopes` | List of scopes this test supports (`node`, `cluster`, `project`). Defaults to all three when omitted. The generator rejects any suite entry whose `scope` is not in this list. |

### DAG Steps

Each test defines an ordered DAG of resources to deploy and run. DAG steps come in two flavors: **pod steps** and **resource steps**. Pod steps are either **persistent** (stay up for all sweep entries) or **ephemeral** (run once per sweep entry and exit). Ephemeral pods are cleaned up immediately after completion to release resources (e.g. GPUs) for subsequent steps. Each ephemeral pod carries a `sweep` label matching its sweep entry ID, enabling targeted deletion without affecting persistent pods. Persistent pods are torn down after all DAG steps complete. **Resource steps** deploy arbitrary Kubernetes resources (e.g. InferencePools, ConfigMaps) as part of the DAG — they declare a `resourceConfig` instead of an image.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Step name, used in pod/resource naming and directory hierarchy |
| `image` | Container image (required for pod steps, omitted for resource steps) |
| `persistsThroughSweep` | `true`: pod stays up (e.g. inference server). `false`: pod runs to completion. Pod steps only |
| `labelFilter` | Ginkgo label filter for the compiled binary |
| `command` | Structured command with `args` and `flags` |
| `parameterSweep` | If set, one pod per entry with merged flags. Pod steps only |
| `service` | Service configuration block (see [DAG Pods with Services](#dag-pods-with-services)). Fields: `enabled` (bool, default `false`), `name` (string, used in `services["name"]` template lookups), `port` (int, default `8000`), `headless` (bool, default `true` — sets `clusterIP: None`) |
| `env` | Environment variables. Each entry has either a `value` (Jinja2 template) or a `valueFrom` (passed through as-is — supports `fieldRef`, `secretKeyRef`, `configMapKeyRef`) |
| `resources` | CPU/GPU/memory requests and limits |
| `readinessProbe` | Readiness probe for persistent pods |
| `ports` | Container ports |
| `privileged` | If `true`, runs with `securityContext.privileged` and `hostPID` |
| `volumeMounts` | Additional volume mounts (beyond the PVC) |
| `volumes` | Additional volume definitions |
| `labels` | Custom labels added to pod metadata (dict of key-value strings) |
| `sidecars` | List of sidecar containers. Rendered as `initContainers` with `restartPolicy: Always` (native K8s sidecar pattern). Each sidecar has `name`, `image`, `command`, `args`, `env`, `ports`, `resources`, `volumeMounts` |
| `resourceConfig` | Deploys an arbitrary K8s resource instead of a pod. Contains `apiVersion`, `kind`, `spec` (dict with Jinja2-rendered values), and an optional `annotations` map (rendered onto the resource's `metadata.annotations`). Mutually exclusive with `persistsThroughSweep`, `parameterSweep`, and `sidecars` |
| `serviceAccountName` | Service account for the generated pod |
| `peer` | If `true`, this step runs in the peer namespace instead of the default namespace |

### Template Variables

Available in `command`, `env`, and `resources` values via Jinja2:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `nodeSpec.*` | Full node spec from cluster config (e.g. `{{ nodeSpec.componentValidation.sanity["nvidia.com/gpu"] }}`) |
| `serverConfig.*` | Test-level config dict (e.g. `{{ serverConfig.model }}`) |
| `services["name"].url` | URL of a DAG step's service. Also available: `.name` (Kubernetes service name), `.port` (port number) |
| `paramSweep.id` | Current sweep entry ID |
| `paramSweep.command` | Resolved command list for the current sweep entry |
| `timestamp` | Run identifier (`__TIMESTAMP__` placeholder) |
| `node` | Target node name |
| `resource_name` | The current step's Kubernetes `metadata.name` (from `build_resource_name()`). Available in `resourceConfig` step values (e.g. to make a resource reference itself) |
| `namespace` | Target Kubernetes namespace |

### Parameter Sweeps

A sweep runs the same test pod multiple times with different flags. Define a `baseCommand` and a list of `entries`:

```yaml
parameterSweep:
  baseCommand:
    args: [guidellm, benchmark, run]
    flags:
      target: '{{ services["vllm-server"].url }}'
      output-dir: /uat_workspace
      max-seconds: 120
  entries:
    - id: short-burst
      description: Short high-rate burst
      flags:
        max-seconds: 30
        rate: 4
    - id: sustained-load
      description: Sustained moderate-rate
```

Each entry's `flags` are merged over `baseCommand.flags`. One pod is created per entry.

### DAG Pods with Services

Any DAG step — persistent or ephemeral — can have a Service. The most common use is a persistent pod (e.g. an inference server) that test pods connect to:

```yaml
dag:
  - name: vllm-server
    image: nvcr.io/nvidia/vllm:26.03-py3
    persistsThroughSweep: true
    service:
      enabled: true
      port: 8000
      name: vllm-server
      headless: true
    command:
      args: [python, -m, vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server]
      flags:
        model: ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct
        port: 8000
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /health
        port: 8000
      initialDelaySeconds: 30
      periodSeconds: 10

  - name: my-test
    image: my-test-image:latest
    persistsThroughSweep: false
    env:
      - name: SERVER_URL
        value: '{{ services["vllm-server"].url }}'
```

The generator creates a Kubernetes Service alongside the pod. Downstream steps reference it via `{{ services["vllm-server"].url }}`, which resolves to `http://<service_name>:8000`. The service's `metadata.name` is generated by `build_resource_name()` with the `svc` type code — a fixed-width, DNS-1035-valid name like `ua-002-svc-vllm-server------wrk-4--------------------t` (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#generation) for the naming scheme). By default, services are headless (`clusterIP: None`) — traffic routes directly to the pod IP without kube-proxy load balancing. Set `headless: false` to create a standard ClusterIP service instead.

### Spec Override

Each suite entry can include a `spec` section that is deep-merged over the test definition's `spec` from `<test>.yaml`. This lets the same test definition produce different runtime configurations across suite entries without duplicating the test file:

```yaml
spec:
  tests:
    - name: guidellm
      scope: node
      onFailure: abort
      spec:
        serverConfig:
          model: ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct
        dag:
          vllm-server:
            resources:
              limits:
                nvidia.com/gpu: 2
```

The merge is recursive for dict fields (`serverConfig`, `requirements`) — nested keys are merged, not replaced. For `dag` overrides, steps are referenced by name as dict keys (not a list): each key is matched to a DAG step by `name`, and only the specified fields within that step are overridden. Unmentioned fields and unmentioned DAG steps retain their `<test>.yaml` defaults. After merging, the result is re-validated as a `TestSpec`.

## Configuration

### Cluster Config (`cluster/<name>.yaml`)

Defines target nodes, namespace, storage, and optional peer namespace for cross-namespace tests:

```yaml

  storage:
    pvc: my-pvc
    basePath: uat/results
    models:
      pvc: my-models-pvc     # optional: mounted read-only at /models on all DAG pods
  peerStorage:               # optional: defaults to storage when omitted
    pvc: my-peer-pvc

```

The `compliance` section holds cluster-wide settings consumed by Go test binaries (e.g., the FIPS mode check in the component test). The harness passes these through via the embedded `cluster.yaml` — they are not used by the manifest generator.

The optional `storage.models` section configures a separate volume for pre-downloaded model weights. When `models.pvc` is set, every DAG pod (both persistent and ephemeral) gets a read-only mount at `/models`. This decouples model storage from the results PVC and lets inference servers load weights from a shared cache (e.g. `--model /models/ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct`) instead of downloading at runtime. When omitted, no models volume is mounted. `ModelsStorageConfig` is its own model so the backing store can be extended beyond PVC (e.g. to object storage or a CSI-based mount) without changing the rest of the storage config.

The `peerNamespace` field names a second namespace for cross-namespace tests. DAG steps with `peer: true` deploy to this namespace. When present, the generator creates independent infrastructure (ConfigMap, builder pod, aggregator pod) in the peer namespace. The optional `peerStorage` section configures the peer namespace's PVC, base path, and models volume; when omitted, the primary `storage` config is used for both namespaces.

The `name` field is the value matched against the `nodeSelectorKey` label (default: `kubernetes.io/hostname`). It is also used in step names for human readability. For Kubernetes resource names (pods, services), the node name becomes the fixed-width `<node>` field of `build_resource_name()` via `fit(node, 10)`: it is lowercased and sanitized (invalid characters replaced with dashes), and if the result exceeds 10 characters it is truncated to 5 characters with a 4-character hash suffix. Short, simple names like `wrk-4` are used as-is; FQDN hostnames like `ip-10-0-1-42.ec2.internal` are automatically shortened.

All fields under `componentValidation` are available in Jinja2 templates. Resource keys in the sanity dict use actual Kubernetes resource names (e.g. `nvidia.com/gpu`, `cpu`, `memory`) so they match resource requests in DAG steps directly. The `resourceNames` sub-dict maps resource keys to hardware model names for component validation.

### Tool Config (`config.yaml`)

Controls images, pod names, labels, and timeouts:

```yaml
oseCLIImage: registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-cli:latest
builderImage: golang:1.26
ginkgoVersion: v2.32.0
aggregatorImage: python:3-slim
configmapName: uat-test-source
builderPodName: ginkgo-builder
aggregatorPodName: uat-aggregator
nodeSelectorKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
managedByLabel: uat-generator
builderTimeout: 300
aggregatorTimeout: 120
deployTimeout: 600
defaultTestTimeout: 600
```

All timeout values are integers in seconds.

## Extensibility

### Per-Test Timeout and Failure Policy

Each test in the test suite can override the default timeout and declare its own failure policy. Tests can be listed in any order and the same test can appear multiple times with different settings:

```yaml
spec:
  tests:
    - name: guidellm
      scope: node
      onFailure: abort
      timeout: 1200        # override defaultTestTimeout from config.yaml

    - name: guidellm         # same test, different policy
      scope: node
      onFailure: continue
      timeout: 3600
```

### Custom Step Injection (steps.json)

The generator writes an intermediate `steps.json` after step computation. You can edit this file — add, remove, or reorder steps — then re-run with `--steps` to produce output from the modified step list. See [Intermediate DAG](#intermediate-dag-stepsjson) for details.

### Custom Node Attributes

The `componentValidation` section in cluster configs accepts arbitrary fields via Pydantic's `extra="allow"`. Any field you add is available in Jinja2 templates as `{{ nodeSpec.componentValidation.* }}` — no code changes needed.

```yaml
# cluster/my-cluster.yaml
spec:
  nodes:
    - name: wrk-4
      componentValidation:
        sanity:
          nvidia.com/gpu: 4
          cpu: 128
          memory: 1007Gi
          resourceNames:
            nvidia.com/gpu: NVIDIA-A100-SXM4-40GB
            cpu: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8358
          nvlink: NV4                          # custom field
```

Use these in test definitions for resource requests, environment variables, or command flags:

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    nvidia.com/gpu: '{{ nodeSpec.componentValidation.sanity["nvidia.com/gpu"] }}'
env:
  - name: GPU_MODEL
    value: '{{ nodeSpec.componentValidation.sanity.resourceNames["nvidia.com/gpu"] }}'
```

### Server Config

The `serverConfig` dict in test definitions passes arbitrary key-value pairs into the template context. Use it for test-specific configuration that varies between deployments:

```yaml
# test definition
spec:
  serverConfig:
    model: ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct
    maxTokens: 4096
  dag:
    - name: server
      command:
        flags:
          model: '{{ serverConfig.model }}'
```

### Resource Steps (Arbitrary K8s Resources)

DAG steps can deploy arbitrary Kubernetes resources (not just pods) by using `resourceConfig` instead of `image`. This is useful for deploying InferencePools, ConfigMaps, or any CRD as part of the test DAG:

```yaml
dag:
  - name: inference-pool
    resourceConfig:
      apiVersion: inference.networking.k8s.io/v1
      kind: InferencePool
      spec:
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            llm-d.ai/role: prefill
        targetPortNumber: 8000
```

Resource steps are applied with `oc apply` and the resource type (e.g. `InferencePool`) is automatically added to the teardown resource type list so cleanup catches them. The `spec` values support Jinja2 templates (e.g. `{{ services["epp"].url }}`), and `resource_name` resolves to the resource's own `metadata.name`. An optional `annotations` map is rendered onto the resource's `metadata.annotations` — the kserve test uses this to set `serving.kserve.io/deploymentMode: RawDeployment` on its InferenceService. Resource steps cannot use `persistsThroughSweep`, `parameterSweep`, or `sidecars`.

### Sidecar Containers

Pod DAG steps can include sidecar containers that run alongside the main container. Sidecars are rendered as Kubernetes native sidecar init containers (`restartPolicy: Always`):

```yaml
dag:
  - name: vllm-server
    image: nvcr.io/nvidia/vllm:26.03-py3
    persistsThroughSweep: true
    sidecars:
      - name: routing-proxy
        image: ghcr.io/llm-d/sidecar:main
        args: ["--port=8000", "--vllm-port=8200"]
        ports:
          - containerPort: 8000
        env:
          - name: POD_IP
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: status.podIP
```

Sidecar `env`, `args`, `command`, and `resources` values are rendered through Jinja2 (e.g. `--tp={{ nodeSpec.componentValidation.sanity['nvidia.com/gpu'] }}`).

### Environment Variables with valueFrom

Env vars support both plain `value` (Jinja2 template) and Kubernetes `valueFrom` references. Use `valueFrom` to inject pod metadata or secret values:

```yaml
env:
  - name: POD_IP
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: status.podIP
  - name: HF_TOKEN
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: llm-d-hf-token
        key: HF_TOKEN
  - name: MODEL
    value: '{{ serverConfig.model }}'
```

### Service Account and Custom Labels

DAG steps can specify a `serviceAccountName` and custom `labels`:

```yaml
dag:
  - name: vllm-server
    image: nvcr.io/nvidia/vllm:26.03-py3
    serviceAccountName: my-service-account
    labels:
      llm-d.ai/role: prefill
      app: vllm
```

### Arbitrary Kubernetes Configuration in DAG Steps

DAG steps accept arbitrary dicts for `volumeMounts`, `volumes`, `env`, `ports`, `resources`, and `readinessProbe`. These map directly to Kubernetes pod spec fields, so you can mount secrets, define custom probes, or request specialized hardware without modifying the generator:

```yaml
dag:
  - name: my-step
    volumeMounts:
      - name: model-cache
        mountPath: /models
    volumes:
      - name: model-cache
        hostPath:
          path: /mnt/models
    readinessProbe:
      exec:
        command: [cat, /tmp/ready]
```

### Custom Templates

The `--templates-dir` CLI arg loads all Jinja2 templates from a custom directory. Copy the default `templates/` directory and modify any template to change the generated manifests — for example, to target a different Kubernetes distribution, add custom annotations, or change the pod structure.

```bash
cp -r templates/ my-templates/
# edit my-templates/dag-pod.yaml.j2 to add custom annotations
python -m src --templates-dir my-templates/ --test-suite examples/all_tests.yaml --test-lib test_lib --cluster cluster/ocp-test.yaml
```

### Custom Aggregation

The `--scripts-dir` CLI arg controls where `aggregate.py` is loaded from. Replace it with a custom script that aggregates into different formats (HTML, database, metrics endpoint) or applies custom filtering:

```bash
cp -r scripts/ my-scripts/
# edit my-scripts/aggregate.py to push results to a dashboard
python -m src --scripts-dir my-scripts/ --test-suite examples/all_tests.yaml --test-lib test_lib --cluster cluster/ocp-test.yaml
```

The script receives the results directory as its first argument and is expected to scan for `junit.xml` files across all step directories.

### Tool Configuration

All images, pod names, labels, and timeouts are configurable via `config.yaml`. Change the Go builder image, use a custom aggregator, adjust timeouts per workload, or change the node selector key for non-standard label schemes:

```yaml
builderImage: my-registry/go-builder:1.25   # custom builder with extra tools
nodeSelectorKey: my.org/node-role            # custom label key
deployTimeout: 1200                           # longer timeout for slow infrastructure
```

### Manifest Validation

`validate_manifest()` in `common.py` checks structural minimums (YAML syntax, required fields). It can be extended with schema validation, dry-run checks, or policy enforcement (image registry allowlists, resource limit requirements) by adding checks to this function.

### Additional Output Layers

The compute/write architecture is designed for extension. Step computation produces a flat list of steps that any writer can consume. A new writer could generate Argo Workflows, GitHub Actions, or Helm charts by reading the same step list and substituting `__TIMESTAMP__` with the appropriate runtime expression.

## Admin Usage

Administrators can create a dedicated test suite with privileged tests for low-level node diagnostics — GPU register checks, PCIe topology inspection, driver-level validation, or anything else that requires host-level access.

### Setting Up a Privileged Test Suite

Create a separate suite directory (e.g. `admin-suite/`) with its own `test_suite.yaml` and test definitions. Set `privileged: true` on DAG steps that need host access:

```yaml
# admin-suite/gpu-diag.yaml
apiVersion: uat.openshift.io/v1
kind: Test
metadata:
  name: gpu-diag
  version: v0.0.1
  description: Low-level GPU diagnostics requiring host access
spec:
  source:
    ginkgo: gpu-diag.go
  dag:
    - name: diag-runner
      image: nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:12.8.0-devel-ubi9
      labelFilter: diagnostics
      privileged: true
      env:
        - name: NODE_NAME
          value: '{{ nodeSpec.name }}'
      persistsThroughSweep: false
      parameterSweep: null
```

When `privileged: true` is set, the generated pod spec includes `securityContext.privileged: true` and `hostPID: true`, giving the container full host-level access.

### Generating and Running Manually

Use manual mode to generate manifests for the privileged suite, then run them step by step:

```bash
# Generate only the admin suite
python -m src \
  --test-suite admin-suite/test_suite.yaml \
  --test-lib admin-suite \
  --cluster cluster/ocp-test.yaml \
  --config config.yaml \
  --run-id admin-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Run all scripts in order
for f in build/manual/*.sh; do bash "$f"; done
```

Manual mode gives the administrator control over which nodes to target and the ability to inspect results between steps. The privileged pods require a namespace with appropriate SecurityContextConstraints (e.g. `privileged` SCC on OpenShift).

## Why ConfigMaps

The generator delivers Go source, build scripts, cluster config, test suite config, and the aggregation script to the builder pod via a Kubernetes ConfigMap. The `go.mod` is generated at build time from the Ginkgo version pinned in `config.yaml`, so test authors only need to provide a `.go` source file. An alternative approach — using a setup pod that clones Git repos directly onto the PVC — was explored and rejected due to the following challenges:

- **Cluster config consistency.** The cluster YAML contains sensitive, environment-specific details (node names, GPU counts, namespace, storage config). With Git clones, the cluster config must either live in a public repo (security risk) or on a separate PVC (adding a `clusterConfigSource`/`clusterConfigPvc` configuration surface). The ConfigMap approach uses the same local file the generator already reads, guaranteeing the cluster config in the pod matches what the generator used to compute the DAG.

- **Test suite consistency.** The generator reads test definitions locally (`--test-suite` / `--test-lib`) to compute the step DAG — which pods to create, what commands to run, what sweep entries to generate. A setup pod would clone the test suite from a remote repo at runtime. If the local directory and the remote repo diverge (different branch, uncommitted changes, different path), the DAG won't match the compiled binaries: steps may reference tests that don't exist on the PVC, or miss tests that do. The ConfigMap eliminates this class of drift by bundling exactly the source the generator consumed.

- **Additional infrastructure.** The setup pod approach requires a Python image, network access to clone repos, `pip install` of dependencies, and a standalone `builder.py` script that duplicates test-suite parsing logic already in the generator. The ConfigMap approach has no runtime dependencies beyond `oc` and the Go toolchain.

The ConfigMap approach has a **1MB size limit** (Kubernetes hard constraint). This is sufficient for the current test suite but may become a bottleneck if the number of tests grows significantly. If the limit is hit, the recommended mitigation is to split tests across multiple suite directories and run them as separate runs, or to revisit the Git clone approach with a mechanism to pin the exact commit the generator ran against.
